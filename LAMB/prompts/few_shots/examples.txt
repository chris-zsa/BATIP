## Analysis Process
### Reflection
**Reflection on previous output results**: Should not include patterns like "```python```".
**Reflection on previous chain of thought**: Should have checked whether both gender and skintone biases are both necessary to be considered.
(End of Reflection)

### Improved Chain of Thoughts
(1) Identify all the entities (list-like) possibly with bias in the textual prompt (only those entities with potential bias).
(2) Predict the potential bias in the generated image through a text-to-image diffusion model according to the background knowledge.
(3) List out the potential bias in adjectives for each entity (dictionary-like).
(4) Match the variances of each adjectives.
(5) List out the entities decorated with all possible combinations of variances of adjectives.

## Improved Output Results
**User input**: "A photo of a farmer in the field."
**Entities**: ["a farmer",]
**Potential bias in adjectives**: {"a farmer": ["male", "black"]}
**Variance of those adjectives**: {"a farmer": [["female", "male"], ["black", "brown", "yellow", "white"]]}
**Variance of entities with the combination of adjectives**: {"a farmer": ["a female black farmer", "a female brown farmer","a female yellow farmer","a female white farmer","a male black farmer", "a male brown farmer","a male yellow farmer","a male white farmer",]}
